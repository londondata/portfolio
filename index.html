					<p>
						I am a Software Engineer and digital enthusiast who has spent my
						life immersed in new technologies. Obsessed with computers, video
						games and geek culture, I've spent the past 13+ years working as a
						digital technology professional; a freelance designer, full stack
						software engineer and former digital marketing entrepreneur. I am
						completely devoted to my craft.
					</p>
					<p>
						Having worked in front end design and web development for years, I
						formalized my education at
						<a href="https://generalassemb.ly/">General Assembly</a>, taking
						both the User Experience Design and Full Stack Web Development
						Immersive (now Software Engineering Immersive) Programs. I have
						discovered an affinity for server side engineering and a profound
						love for Python and Django during this time. I am currently teaching
						both software engineering and front end web development as a Lead
						Instructor at my alma mater
						<a href="https://generalassemb.ly/instructors/teri-london/25608"
							>General Assembly</a
						>
						and one day hope to pursue my long term goal of making video games.
						In my spare time I freelance, consult, study new technologies and
						pursue my passion projects.
					</p>
					<p>
						My technical skills include: Software Engineering, Web Design &
						Development, User Experience and User Interface Design, HCI,
						Information Architecture and Wordpress. My proficient coding
						languages include: HTML & CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, React.js,
						Node.js, Express, MongoDB, Mongoose, Python & Django.

						In addition to my technological and nerdy pursuits, I am the mother
						to two adorable cats and many lovely plants, my favorite band is
						Nine Inch Nails and I am always down for karaoke. While located in
						San Francisco, I have roots in Los Angeles and Ft. Lauderdale and
						hail originally from Cleveland, where I have remained loyal to all
						local sports teams.
